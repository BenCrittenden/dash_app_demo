# Plotly Dash Tutorial

This project introduces students to plotly dash through building the own app in a step-wise process. The project comprises 5 apps that gradually grow in complexity as you add more components. 

Apps 2, 3 and 4 have tutorial and complete versions.

The app plots the election results from the 2017 general election and then lets you play around with the results.
